  %p Kittypad.com is the homepage for our education platform, which consists of two main portals: one for parents and one for developers. The parent portal consists of the Pad Dashboard that is used to make the iPad an unrivaled learning tool for parents and kids. The developers' portal includes other tools that developers use to make better applications for you!

  %h3 How much does it cost?

  %h3 Do I need an IPad?

  %h3 Why should I use this service?
  %p Kitty Pad’s services allow parents to be more in control of the “loose cannon”-so to speak-that can be the IPad. Parents can now fully monitor their child’s educational development and growth. Eventually, as the Kitty Pad service grows Kitty Pad will provide recommendations for apps tailored to your child. This will help you make sense of the mess of applications available in the App Store, giving you options most suitable for your child.

  %h3 Why should I use Kitty Pad’s SDK?

  %h3 About the Pad Dashboard
  %p The Pad Dashboard is a tool that parents can utilize to maximize potential educational value of the IPad. The trouble with the IPad as it stands right now is that with the slide of a finger it transforms from educator to nothing but another game console. With the Pad Dashboard gone are the days where kids can say, “Don’t worry, I’m not playing games I’m practicing math!” while actually doing something else with unhappy birds or slicing fruit to bits.

  %p In the Parent Dashboard space parents can set times for breaks to help kids manage screen time.

  %p Parents set times for short breaks, every 10 minutes or so, to ask kids to rest their eyes. After a duration of play, kids will be told to take a longer break, to go outside and breathe some fresh air. This feature also includes our Anti-Repetitive Stress Injury software, with prevents pain and injury due to overuse of electronics.

  %p The other major component of the Pad Dashboard is the “Trends” feature. Here, parents can eventually see how their child compares with other children in his or her age group. Relevant statistics regarding grades and performance and time spent on Ipad applications will be prepared for parents to examine. Parents can also view each child's history and carefully watch how children progress and make improvements over time.

  %p Finally, KittyPad is making an effort to make sense out of the mess that is the App Store. We will provide recommendations for free and paid apps tailored to your child’s needs.
